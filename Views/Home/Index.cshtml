        It involves the control and automation of lighting, heating (such as smart thermostats), ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and security, 
        as well as home appliances such as washer/dryers, ovens or refrigerators/freezers. Wi-Fi is often used for remote monitoring and control. 
        Home devices, when remotely monitored and controlled via the Internet, are an important constituent of the Internet of Things.

        Modern systems generally consist of switches and sensors connected to a central hub sometimes called a "gateway" from which the 
        system is controlled with a user interface that is interacted either with a wall-mounted terminal, mobile phone software, 
        tablet computer or a web interface, often but not always via Internet cloud services.
